    <h3>Herle queen</h3>
    <p>Shawon grew up in a largely working class neighborhood in a small tin-roofed home that overlooked the ocean. Shawon was introduced to the game of soccer through his dad, who worked as an equipment manager at a boy's club. His early life was shaped by hardship, as his father often drank too much. Shawon made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation's all-time top goalscorer. He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Shawon was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation.</p>

    <h3>The ghost part-1</h3>
    <img src="jocker.jpg" alt="">
    <p>horror story, a story in which the focus is on creating a feeling of fear. Such tales are of ancient origin and form a substantial part of the body of folk literature. They can feature supernatural elements such as ghosts, witches, or vampires, or they can address more realistic psychological fears. In Western literature the literary cultivation of fear and curiosity for its own sake began to emerge in the 18th-century pre-Romantic era with the Gothic novel.</p>
